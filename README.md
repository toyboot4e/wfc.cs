# Wfc

wfc.cs is an implementation of the [WaveFunctionCollapse algorithm](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse) of overlapping model.

Use `dotnet` to run the example:

```sh
$ dotnet run --project Example/Example.csproj
```

## Note

We need a `.sln` file so that OmniSharp works (when using VSCode).
